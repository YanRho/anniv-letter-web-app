### Customizing the Letter Content

You can update the text in the letter by modifying the `info.txt` file located in the project folder.

#### Format of `info.txt`

```json
{
  "name": "Partner's Name",
  "anniversaryDate": "2023-01-09T00:00:00",
  "message": "Here's to every second spent with you. I cherish each moment and look forward to forever. I love you!",
  "personalMessage": "Custom Hearfelt Message Here",
  "signature": "Your Name"
}
```

- **`anniversaryDate`**: The starting date of the anniversary. This is calculated and displayed as a title
- **`name`**: The name of the recipient.
- **`personalMessage`**: The customized message for your partner.
- **`signature`**: How you'd like to sign off the letter.

### Known Issues

If you open the `index.html` file directly in your browser (via `file://`), the `letter.html` page will not display the content due to browser restrictions (CORS policy). Use a local server as described above.
